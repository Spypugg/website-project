      <p class="size-matters">VTOL VR is a near-future
         VR mil-fantasy flight game developed by Paolo Encarnaci√≥n, 
        also known as BahamutoD, of Boundless Dynamics,
         original creator of the BDArmory mod for Kerbal Space Program.
         It is centered around air combat, putting players in
          one of three aircraft in a military environment.
          Players can interact with each button and switch in their cockpit to control their aircraft;
           no keyboard or even HOTAS interaction is required. 
           Players can take on a number of different enemies,
            including hostile aircraft, ground units,
             and even naval ships with a plethora of strong weaponry.</p>

        <img src="img/AH-94.jpg">
        <p>The AH-94 (Dragonfly) Which is personally my favorite, is a dedicated attack helicopter 
          designed chiefly for air-to-ground combat. It was released
           on January 6, 2022, as VTOL VR's first DLC. The AH-94 is known
            for its high manoeuvrability and responsiveness, allowing it
             to fill many close-range air support roles on the battlefield.</p></li>

        <img src="img/FA-26.webp">
    <p>The F/A-26B (Wasp) is a playable twin engine multi-role fighter 
      aircraft, being the second aircraft to be added into VTOL VR.
       It is known for its sheer armament capacity,
        giving it the ability to equip a myriad of different weapons 
        while still maintaining an acceptable Thrust to Weight Ratio.
         It is designed for Air-to-Air combat, but it is equally
          capable of Air-to-Ground combat as well. It serves as one of
           the most common fighters in the allied fleet, 
           being nearly essential for large-scale air-based offensives.</p></li>

    <li><p><a class="about" href="https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/F-45A" target="_blank"><b>F-45A (Ghost)</b></a></p>
    <img  src="img/F-45A.webp">
    <p>The F-45A (Ghost) is a sleek aircraft available to the Allied faction
       designed with stealth engagement in mind. It is a multi-purpose 
       stealth aircraft with internal weapon bays and an advanced sensor suite.
        It is the only playable aircraft in the game that has an integrated internal
         weapons bay, allowing it to store its munitions inside the aircraft 
         until needed. This has two main implications for the F-45A: it decreases
          drag across the aircraft, allowing it to reach higher In-Air Speeds,
           while also decreasing its radar cross-section as well, letting it both
            move closer to a radar source before detection and escape radar locks
             more easily through conventional evasive maneuvers.</p></li>

    <li><p><a class="about" href="https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/AV-42C" target="_blank"><b>AV-42C (Kestrel)</b></a></p>
    <img src="img/AV-42C.webp">
    <p>The AV-42C (also known as the Kestrel) is a Tilt-jet VTOL Attack/Transport
       aircraft available to the Allied faction. It was the first aircraft
        implemented in VTOL VR and largely serves as the game's namesake.
         Its tilt-jet VTOL flight setup gives it a surprising amount of mobility 
         in the field. It is capable of taking off from and landing on both
          landing strips and helipads alike. Though it does not have as many 
          weapon slots as the F/A-26B, and is more limited in the kinds of armaments
           it is capable of deploying, it makes up for this disparity with 
           the already-formidable and versatile armaments it can equip. 
           Coupled with its VTOL capabilities, the AV-42C can be a strong close 
           air support asset when dealing with surface targets due to its high
            mobility.</p></li>
